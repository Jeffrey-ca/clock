# clock
1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This project involved making a clock that displayed 12 and 24hour time and also increase the time.

2. What did you do particularly well?
  I think I did the display well and fixing the bugs throughout coding it. I would fix one problem and then another one
  would appear which helped me make the program better overall. 


3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I would make the code better when it comes to adding time to the clocks.
  
4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and
 how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to 
your support network?
  The code I found most challenging to write was the adding time to the clocks just because there was so many type conversions that would break the program 
  or have unintended side effects.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  I think learning how to find bugs and problems to fix them is a big skill that I definetly imrpoved on during this project. I troubleshot a lot of problems
  that were simple but also taught me more about this.

6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I tried to use definitions to my advantage to simplify the code but it might not have worked well.
